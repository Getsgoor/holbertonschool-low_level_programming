We saw two main types of commit:
-feat : for adding new things (new scripts or programs);
-fix : to fir a bug or an error from a previous feat commit.

We have to make a description :
	-Use the imperative present("change" not "changed" nor "changes")
	-Do not capitalize the first letter
	-do not end the description with a period
	-do not put the files names in the description

It has to describe with precision what is added or changes, but can't be too long.
